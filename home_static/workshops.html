	<h3>Hosting an official QIIME workshop</h3>
    Official QIIME workshops are led by the QIIME Masters (QM). A QM is developer or expert who is the lead moderator on the <a href="http://forum.qiime.org">QIIME forum</a> for 2 weeks, around 2 times per year. This commitment requires that the QM read and reply (or delegate replies) to all incoming forum questions (currently around 1000 emails per month), so greatly increases their knowledge of QIIME and common issues with QIIME. After serving as a QM, they are experts not only in QIIME's algorithms and pipelines, but also in know how to troubleshoot software and methodological problems. The full list of QIIME Masters and how many times they have been in charge of the forum are:

    If you are interested in hosting an official QIIME workshop (for example, at your university or at a conference) you'll need two QMs for up to 25 participants, and one additional QM per additional (up to) 25 participants. The cost per day for each QM is $500USD, plus their travel, lodging and meal expenses. Under special circumstances we may be able to reduce the cost per day.

    Antonio Gonzalez (antgonza@gmail.com) and Greg Caporaso (gregcaporaso@gmail.com) are currently organizing the official QIIME workshops. If you are interested in hosting one, or in becoming a QM, you should contact them. If you're interested in hosting a workshop, please include the following information in your message:    
    <ul>
        <li>Would this be a dedicated QIIME workshop, or part of a more general workshop? If the latter, is the workshop focused primarily on biology, software development, bioinformatics, another topic, or some combination of those?</li>
        <li>What is goal of the workshop (for example, for students to develop an understanding of QIIME's algorithms or pipelines, to assist students with analyzing their own data, to instruct students interested in software development, etc)?</li>
        <li>How many participants are you expecting?</li>
        <li>Do the participants have their own datasets? If so, what sequencing platform are they using? Will they be bringing data with them to the workshop?</li>
        <li>Do the participants typically work with amplicon survey (i.e., 16S rRNA, ITS, ...) data, or whole community shotgun data? If amplicon data, what genes and primers do they use?</li>
        <li>What kind of computer resources do you have that would be available during the workshop?</li>
    </ul>
