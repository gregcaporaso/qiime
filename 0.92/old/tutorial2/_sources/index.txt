Introduction
============
This tutorial explains how to use the **QIIME** (Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology) 
Pipeline to process data from high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing studies. The purpose of this 
pipeline is to provide a start-to-finish workflow, beginning with multiplexed sequence reads and 
finishing with taxonomic and phylogenetic profiles and comparisons of the samples in the study. 
With this information in hand, it is possible to determine biological and environmental factors that
alter microbial community ecology in your experiment.

As an example, we will use data from a study of the response of mouse gut microbial communities to 
fasting (Crawford et al., 2009). To make this tutorial run quickly on a personal computer, we will 
use a subset of the data generated from 5 animals kept on the control ad libitum fed diet, and 4 
animals fasted for 24 hours before sacrifice. At the end of our tutorial, we will be able to 
compare the community structure of control vs. fasted animals. In particular, we will be able to 
compare taxonomic profiles for each sample type, differences in diversity metrics within the 
samples and between the groups, and perform comparative clustering analysis to look for overall 
differences in the samples.

To process our data, we will perform the following steps, each of which is described in more detail 
in the Data Analysis Steps:

* Filter the sequence reads for quality and assign multiplexed reads to starting samples by nucleotide barcode.
* Pick Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) based on sequence similarity within the reads, and pick a representative sequence from each OTU.
* Assign the OTU to a taxonomic identity using reference databases.
* Align the OTU sequences and create a phylogenetic tree.
* Calculate diversity metrics for each sample and compare the types of communities, using the taxonomic and phylogenetic assignments.
* Generate UPGMA and PCoA plots to visually depict the differences between the samples, and dynamically work with these graphs to generate publication quality figures.
