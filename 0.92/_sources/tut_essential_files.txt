Essential Files
===============
All the files you will need for this tutorial are here (http://qiime.sourceforge.net/qiime_tutorial.zip). Descriptions of these files are below.

Sequences (.fna)
----------------
This is the 454-machine generated FASTA file. Using the Amplicon processing software on the 454 FLX standard, each region of the PTP plate will yield a fasta file of form :file:`1.TCA.454Reads.fna`, where "1" is replaced with the appropriate region number. For the purposes of this tutorial, we will use the fasta file :file:`Fasting_Example.fna`.

Quality Scores (.qual)
----------------------
This is the 454-machine generated quality score file, which contains a score for each base in each sequence included in the FASTA file. Like the fasta file mentioned above, the Amplicon processing software will generate one of these files for each region of the PTP plate, named :file:`1.TCA.454Reads.qual`, etc. For the purposes of this tutorial, we will use the quality scores file :file:`Fasting_Example.qual`.

Mapping File (Tab-delimited .txt)
---------------------------------
The mapping file is generated by the user. This file contains all of the information about the samples necessary to perform the data analysis. At a minimum, the mapping file should contain the name of each sample, the barcode sequence used for each sample, the linker/primer sequence used to amplify the sample, and a Description column. In general, you should also include in the mapping file any metadata that relates to the samples (for instance, health status or sampling site) and any additional information relating to specific samples that may be useful to have at hand when considering outliers (for example, what medications a patient was taking at time of sampling). Full format specifications can be found in the Documentation.

You are highly encouraged to validate your mapping file using `check_id_map.py <./scripts/check_id_map.html>`_ before attempting to analyze your data. This tool will check for errors, and make suggestions for other aspects of the file to be edited (errors and warnings are output to a log file, and suggested changes to invalid characters are output to a :file:`corrected_mapping.txt` file). For the purposes of this tutorial, we will use the mapping file :file:`Fasting_Map.txt`. The contents of the mapping file are shown here - as you can see, a nucleotide barcode sequence is provided for each of the 9 samples, as well as metadata related to treatment group and date of birth, and general run descriptions about the project.

Flowgram File (.sff) - (Optional)
---------------------------------
This is the 454-machine generated file which stores the sequencing trace data. This is the largest file returned from a 454 run. The sffinfo command in the 454 software package can be used to generate sequence and quality files from sff file(s) as follows

To generate a fasta file ::

	sffinfo -s NAME_OF_SFF_FILES > OUTPUT_NAME.fna

To generate a quality score file ::

	sffinfo -q NAME_OF_SFF_FILES >OUTPUT_NAME.qual
